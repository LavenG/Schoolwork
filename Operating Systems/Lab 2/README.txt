Compile the program with:

javac Process.java Scheduler.java

To run the program:

Normal Output: java Scheduler InputFilePath
Verbose Output: java Scheduler --verbose InputFilePath

Example:

java Scheduler input-1
java Scheduler --verbose input-1

Notes:
- Tasked with simulating OS process scheduling algorithms. 
- Program outputs results for all 4 algorithms at once.
- Inputs were processed with parentheses as they originally appear on the class website.
- All outputs match provided outputs barring some miniscule rounding differences in the summaries.
